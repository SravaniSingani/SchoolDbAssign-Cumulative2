# SchoolDbAssign-Cumulative2


## Main Features 
The SchoodDbAssign project accesses the Schood database. The project displays: 
-  List of teachers from the database
-  Shows teacher details from the database
- Allows to add and delete a teacher
  
## Additional Initiatives

- A form validation using javascript to check the details of the teachers entered. It also checks for the regular expression for employee number (T678, T111 etc). It checks the salary for decimal pattern (55.67, 66.6 etc)
- Added json file with curl commands in the json file in repo.
